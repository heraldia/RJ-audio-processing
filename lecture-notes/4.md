audio recognition module -> google sdk
batch generate audio files.

data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique in machine learning and deep learning that artificially increases the size and diversity of a training dataset by applying various transformations to existing data samples.

study case : you and your professor
experiement: multiple hearing.
multiple metrics -> compare : generated audio file and target audio file. 
metrics - comparison algorithm:  -> similarity.
2 metrics - 2 comparison algorithm:  -> 2 similarity.
3 metrics - 3 comparison algorithm:  -> 3 similarity.

audio file -> adjust some parameters (frequency) -> embedding -> vector values are changing
ml

<- target audio file -> embedding -> similar vector values ->  adjust some parameters (frequency)
